### Welcome to IncIn, an inline C interpreter 

To run, 
$`bash incin.sh`

You could of course add it to your path and then call it like `incin` anywhere. 

The program takes your input, puts it inside a simple c program, compiles and returns you the result. It doesn't remember the previous actions (yet!).

Just a simple experiment, however, if you find it useful, let me know. 

Should be helpful for anyone coming from a language like python or ruby to quickly test syntax of statements in c. 

#### Demo
`$ bash incin.sh`

`Welcome to IncIn, an inline interpreter for c`

`>>> float a = 4.23123123; printf("A = %0.2f", a);`

`A = 4.23`

`>>>`
